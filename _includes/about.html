                    <p>Well, my office ID says that I'm a Software Developer but when you get down from it, I'm much more than that.<br/><br/>
I'm a computer science enthusiast, I have a keen appetite to learn about different computers, how do they function, their architecture etc. I love programming, it helped me think quite differently. I love the internet. To be honest, I think it's a parallel universe (or sort of).<br/><br/>
I've been able to survive about 23 years on this planet in a place called "New Delhi". I very much believe that I can make a difference in my field of work, maybe even make this world a better place, which makes me optimistic. I'm quite weird, perhaps it's a side effect of being awesome ;)</p>
