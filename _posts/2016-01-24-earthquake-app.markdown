An android application which fetches the earthquakes data from USGS server and inflates the app screen with the list of earthquakes in a very elegant and easy to navigate manner.
The app also has a map, with markers pointing at earthquakes locations, to help a user visualize the data and different types of filters to extract only relevant information.<br/>
<br/>
Earthquake app helps you track latest earthquakes from around the globe by showing earthquakes of 0.1+ magnitude from the United States and of 4.5+ magnitude worldwide.
This app uses data from <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What is USGS?</b>

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is a science organization of the United States government. USGS provides impartial information on our ecosystems and environment, natural hazards, natural resources, the impacts of climate and the core science systems.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Features:</b>

- Shows earthquakes from the past hour, day, week or even a month.<br/>
- Choose between different types of map.<br/>

<br/>
<b>What does color coded mean?</b>

It means that earthquakes of different magnitudes will be shown via different color pins on the map and different background colors in the list.<br/>

4.5 <= M -- <i style="color:#FF4444">Red</i> <br/>
3.5 <= M -- <i style="color:#FFBB33">Yellow</i> <br/>
2.5 <= M -- <i style="color:#AA66CC">Purple</i> <br/>
1.5 <= M -- <i style="color:#33B5E5">Blue</i> <br/>
1.5 > M -- <i style="color:#99CC00">Green</i> <br/>

<b>Note</b>: Some quakes takes longer than usual to show up. I can't do anything about it as I don't own the database servers.<br/>
